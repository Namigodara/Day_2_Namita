Q1. What is Python?
Ans: Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language
    with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined
    with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid
    Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language
    to connect existing components together.

Q2: What are the features of the Python?
Ans:
There are many features in Python, some of which are discussed below –

1. Easy to code:
Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the
language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc.
It is very easy to code in python language and anybody can learn python basics
in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language.

2.Open Source and Free
Python is an open-source programming language which means that anyone can
create and contribute to its development. Python has an online forum where
thousands of coders gather daily to improve this language further.
Along with this Python is free to download and use in any operating system,
be it Windows, Mac or Linux.

3. Object-Oriented Language:
One of the key features of python is Object-Oriented programming.
Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, objects
encapsulation, etc.

4.Support for GUI
GUI or Graphical User Interface is one of the key aspects of any programming
language because it has the ability to add flair to code and make the results
more visual. Python has support for a wide array of GUIs which can easily be
imported to the interpreter, thus making this one of the most favorite
languages for developers.

5. High-Level Language:
Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in python, we do not
need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory.

6. Extensible feature:
Python is a Extensible language. We can write us some Python code into C or C++
language and also we can compile that code in C/C++ language.

7.Python is Portable language:
Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have python
code for windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as
Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on
any platform.

8. Python is Integrated language:
Python is also an Integrated language because we can easily integrated python
with other languages like c, c++, etc.

9. Interpreted Language:
Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line
at a time. like other languages C, C++, Java, etc. there is no need to compile
python code this makes it easier to debug our code.

10. Large Standard Library
Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of module and
functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing.
There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions,
unit-testing, web browsers, etc.

11. Dynamically Typed Language:
Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means the type (for example- int,
double, long, etc.) for a variable is decided at run time not in advance
because of this feature we don’t need to specify the type of variable.
